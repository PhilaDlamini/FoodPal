Have food you don't want and/or might throw out? FoolPal makes it easy to donate it to someone who might use it.
Just write a quick description of the food, take a few pictures of it, and upload it on the app, and someone on the other side 
can claim it and come collect it from you. 

FoodPal is coming to the App Store as a free software update this Fall
